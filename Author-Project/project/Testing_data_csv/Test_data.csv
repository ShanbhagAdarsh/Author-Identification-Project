a.png,A01-00O,Adarsh Shanbhag,"A MOVE to stop Mr. Gaitskell from nominating any more Labour life Peers is to be made at a meeting of Labour M Ps tomorrow. Mr. Michael Foot has put down a resolution on the subject and he is to be backed by Mr. Will Griffiths, M P for Manchester Exchange."
b.png,A01-003,Rakshit Handral,"Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a large majority of Labour M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution. Mr. Foot�s line will be that as Labour M Ps opposed the Government Bill which brought life peers into existence, they should not now put forward nominees. He believes that the House of Lords should be abolished and that Labour should not take any steps which would appear to ""prop up� an out-dated institution."
c.png,A01-007,Amit Bongale,"Since 1958, 13 Labour life Peers and Peeresses have been created. Most Labour sen-timent would still favour the abolition of the House of Lords, but while it remains Labour has to have an adequate number of members. THE two rival African Nation-alist Parties of Northern Rhodesia have agreed to get together to face the challenge from Sir Roy Welensky, the Federal Premier."
d.png,A01-014,Manushree Bhat,"Sir Roy�s United Federal Party is boycotting the London talks on the Protectorate�s future. Said Mr. Nkumbula last night: �We want to discuss what to do if the British Government gives in to Sir Roy and the talks fall through. There are bound to be demonstrations.� Yesterday Sir Roy�s chief aide, Mr. Julius Greenfield, telephoned his chief a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan at Chequers."
e.png,A02-004,Akshay K,"So the idea of a personal mission by the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped. Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a hand-picked team under the leadership of Sir Pierson Dixon, Britain�s Ambassador to France, to back Mr. Edward Heath, Lord Privy Seal, who is charged with the conduct of negotiations with the Six. At the same time the Prime Minister has offered Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to safeguard their interests."
f.png,A02-012,Nagashree Bhat,"The team is composed of experienced negotiators in several fields. Sir Pierson Dixon has a wide reputation as a skilful backstage negotiator since his days as Britain�s chief UN delegate. Second in command is Mr. Eric Roll, 53-year-old Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Fisheries. The Foreign Office is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay, who has taken part in all the detailed Common Market exchanges over the past year with the French, Germans, and Italians."
g.png,A02-062,Lakshmi K B,"A third man�s house was watched for four days by plain-clothes men. Committee- member Mr. George Clark commented at a Press conference: �The most extraor- dinary things are happening.� Fifty committee members will appear at Bow-street today, including Lord Russell, Lady Russell, Lord Boyd-Orr, the Rev. Michael Scott, and Mr. Clark."
h.png,A03-020,Harshwardhan Javli,"Prince Souvanna�s former Minister of Information, Mr. Quinim Pholsena, who claims to be his representative in Laos, yesterday addressed all officers of the pro-communist forces occupying the province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Sou- vanna�s Government was the only legal one in the country. Prince Souphannouvong, leader of the pro-communist Neo Lao Haksat Party, also spoke to the officers in the same terms."
i.png,A05-004,Vithal Madar,"Short of wearing the same uniform, which is not contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force would become, for practical purposes, a single defence force. There would be complete co-operation at all levels in training and operations. This would apply also in the command structure and central administrative organisation. Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence, has been working on the plan for some months, with the Prime Minister�s approval."
j.png,A06-095,Anvitha Shanbhag,"Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help to the Commonwealth through the strength we would gain in the Common Market than by isolation. He paid tribute to the development of the Common Market. �The Community (Common Market) has imparted an impetus and an economic growth to The Six. Above all, it is an idea which has gripped men�s minds,� he said."
k.png,B04-026,Arpita Shanbhag,"The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in Britain today! �THIS is colour day,� proclaimed the American television network, N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its programmes in bright colours. In America colour TV is five years old. There are already 600,000 sets in use. What about Britain? The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service, but the commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years."
l.png,RO6-044,Anirudh Shanbhag,"They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses. Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and throttled to death by his wife, children and father-in-law, after muddling up some sheep while the worse for drink. The family group then sat down for a late lunch before the father-in-law telephoned the police. Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family troubles, had written to the local paper and the superintendent of police, informing them that he was on the point of committing suicide, and gratefully leaving his house appurtenances and utensils to the superintendent."
